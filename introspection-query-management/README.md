# Introspection Query Management

GraphQL has an [introspection system](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection) that allows users to ask a schema for information about the queries it supports. GraphQL introspection queries can be useful for developers using code generation tools or for implementing build pipelines, but enabling them can expose sensitive information, so it is best practice to [disable them in production](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/security/why-you-should-disable-graphql-introspection-in-production/).

Brightspot makes it possible to create introspection query rules that allow or block introspection queries based on custom logic. This example demonstrates how to create an introspection query rule that only allows access if a specific HTTP header is passed, serving as a way to control who can make introspection queries.

> **_Note_** In Brightspot, GraphQL Introspection is disabled by default in production mode.

## Using the example application

The front end application uses types generated by the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) as part of the build pipeline. GraphQL Code Generator is set up to run introspection queries on the `Introspection Query Management` endpoint.

Those introspection queries fail if they do not include an `Introspection-Key` HTTP header with a value that matches the same field on the endpoint. To demonstrate this, run the following command from the `introspection-query-management/app` directory. An error message will appear saying the command failed.

```sh
$ yarn codegen
```

```
error Command failed with exit code 1.
```

Navigate through Brightspot to edit the endpoint at **☰** &rarr; **Admin** &rarr; **APIs** &rarr; **Endpoints** &rarr; **Introspection Query Management** and save any string value (ex. abcd1234) in the `Introspection Key` field. Then change the value of the `INTROSPECTION-KEY` environment variable in the `introspection-query-management/app/.env` file to match the value you used in Brightspot. Run the following command again and the GraphQL Code Generator will be able to run the introspection queries and create the files, types, and hooks that the front end application needs in order to start.

```sh
$ yarn codegen
```

## How everything works

### 1. Create an introspection query rule

An introspection query rule is a class that implements the `IntrospectionQueryRule` Java Interface and provdides the body of the `isAllowed()` method. The `isAllowed()` method returns true or false based on whether a particular query should be allowed.

```ts
[`isAllowed()`](): boolean {
  return false // blocks all introspection queries
}
```

In this example application, the [introspection query rule](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/introspection_query_management/ExampleIntrospectionQueryRule.ts) provides an `isAllowed()` method body that compares the value of the `Introspection-Key` HTTP header to the value of an `introspectionKey` Java Field storied within the rule. It returns `true` when the values match, thereby allowing the introspection query.

### 2. Apply the rule to an endpoint

For an introspection query rule to take affect, it must be applied to an endpoint by overriding the endpoint's `getIntrospectionQueryRule()` method and returning a new instance of the introspection query rule class.

```ts
getIntrospectionQueryRule(): IntrospectionQueryRule {
  const ExampleIntrospectionQueryRule = ClassFinder.getClass(
    'brightspot.example.introspection_query_management.ExampleIntrospectionQueryRule'
  )

  return new ExampleIntrospectionQueryRule()
}
```

This example application uses an `Introspection Key` that is configurable through the Brightspot UI. It adds an `introspectionKey` Java Field to the [endpoint](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/introspection_query_management/IntrospectionQueryManagementEndpoint.ts) and assigns its value to the `introspectionKey` field of the introspection query rule within the `getIntrospectionQueryRule()` method body.

### 3. Configure the build pipeline to factor in the rule

> **_Note_** The specific configuration of a build pipeline that leverages an introspection query rule is dependent on the front end framework being used, the build tools being used, and the business logic in the introspection rule. The pipeline in this example is one of many possible options.

This example uses GraphQL Code Generator to create types and hooks. It is configured with the `codegen.yml` file in the `introspection-query-management/app` directory. The name of the introspection key header is defined here and its value is derived from an environment variable in the `.env` file within the same directory.

[`codegen.yml`](./app/codegen.yml) :

```yml
schema:
  - ${REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URL}:
      headers:
        Introspection-Key: ${INTROSPECTION_KEY}
```

[`.env`](./app/.env) :

```
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost/graphql/delivery/introspection-query-management
INTROSPECTION_KEY=your-introspection-key-here
```

The front end application includes a script in the `package.json` file to run the GraphQL Code Generator with the command `yarn codegen`. This runs the introspection queries using the configuration defined above.

[`package.json`](./app/package.json)

```json
"scripts": {
    "codegen": "graphql-codegen --require dotenv/config --config codegen.yml",
  }
```

The end result is a GraphQL API that is open to the public but with introspection queries available only to those that know the value of the configured introspection key.

## Try it yourself

The following is a suggestion for learning more about GraphQL introspection with JS Classes and Brightspot:

- Try changing the introspection query rule to support multiple keys.
