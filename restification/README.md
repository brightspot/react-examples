## GraphQL RESTification

Scenarios could arise where your client-side application is not inherently equipped to handle GraphQL but you want the benefit that GraphQL provides, GraphQL's types system for one brings predictable results along with auto-generated documentation and GraphQL's ability to only return the data you need or are going to use.

GraphQL Restification involves converting a GraphQL API into a RESTful API. This means replacing a single GraphQL endpoint with multiple RESTful endpoints, each representing a distinct resource or data object. This grants the benefit of controlling the structure of the response, specifically choosing what fields to return when a certain endpoint is called rather than all of it.

This example demonstrates how to set up GraphQL queries into individual REST API endpoints.

## What you will learn

1. [Use Brightspot to create REST Mapping API endpoints](#1-create-rest-mapping-api-endpoints).
2. [Use the GraphQL schema for type generation at build time and runtime without exposing the endpoint to the public](#2-use-the-graphql-schema-for-type-generation-without-exposing-the-endpoint-to-the-public).

## Running the example application

> **_Note_** Just starting? Refer to the [README](/README.md) at the root of the `react-examples` repository for details on running example applications in depth.

### Install dependencies

Run the following command from the `restification/app` directory:

```sh
$ yarn
```

```

The front-end application will not function correctly until the steps are completed.

## Step 1: Publish Member Content

In Brightspot, publish at least one **Member** content type.

## Step 2: Building the Query and Create REST Mapping

In Brightspot from the menu **&#x2630;**, navigate to **Developer** &rarr; **GraphQL Explorer** and select **Members API: Restification** from the **Select GraphQL Endpoint** dropdown.

In the explorer panel on the left pane you see a GraphQL query field named **brightspot_example_restification_MemberQuery**.

In this example, the query created retrieves all members, restricting the data returned to only the members' display name.

Copy and paste the followng query into the explorer:

```graphql
query AllMembers {
  ListOfMembers: brightspot_example_restification_MemberQuery {
    members: items {
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

To test the query, click the play/execute button.

#### 1. Create REST mapping API endpoints

After testing the query, create the first REST Map, click the Cog icon in the GraphQL Explorer (located on the right hand side of the page) and select **Create REST Mapping**. The **New GraphQL REST Mapping** form pops up:

| REST Mapping Endpoint Form                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="Color Palette for Color Picker" src="documentation/images/all-members-rest-map.png"> |

The **REST Endpoint** is pre-selected with **Create New...** being the first REST Endpoint created.

1. Under **REST Mapping Name**, **AllMembers** will be pre-populated. This is based on the query name.
2. Under **REST Mapping Method(s)**, ensure that **GET** request is selected.
3. Under **REST Mapping Path**, the REST mapping path is automatically generated as **/all-members** from the query name.
4. Click **Create**.

As this is the first mapping, the GraphQL Explorer creates a new form with the title **New REST GraphQL Mapping API**

| REST Mapping API Form                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="Color Palette for Color Picker" src="documentation/images/rest-mapping-form.png"> |

1. Under **Name**, enter 'Members API'.
2. Under Access, select **Anyone**. Otherwise, access will inherit based on the endpoint used to create the REST mapping(s) from. In this case, a content management endpoint is being used, which always needs a client with an id and secret.
3. Click **Save**.

> - After entering the name, the **Path Prefix** section automatically generates **/members-api**
> - The **GraphQL Endpoint** section defaults to **GraphQL REST API** if it is the only endpoint. Select **GraphQL REST API** from the dropdown if there are multiple endpoints.
> - The **Paths** section at the bottom generates: **/members-api/all-members**.

Repeat the process using the following query:

```graphql
query Member($arguments: [String]) {
  Member: brightspot_example_restification_MemberQuery(
    where: { predicate: "displayName = ?", arguments: $arguments }
  ) {
    members: items {
      displayName
      email
    }
  }
}
```

At the bottom of the explorer, pull up the 'QUERY VARIABLES' section and put in the variable to test. Your variable looks similar to the following:

```json
{
  "arguments": "<Member Display Name Here>"
}
```

Test the query to confirm the results are as expected.

Create the REST Mapping for the query:

| REST Mapping Endpoint Form                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="Color Palette for Color Picker" src="documentation/images/member-rest-map.png"> |

The form will be automatically completed but under 'REST Mapping Method(s)', be sure to select 'POST' so that it displays both GET and POST.

1. Test the GET endpoint by visiting '[http://localhost/members-api/all-members](http://localhost/members-api/all-members)' into your browser.
2. Test the second REST mapping endpoint with a GET request made with the display name as the parameter by visiting 'http://localhost/members-api/member?arguments={Member Display Name Here}' in your browser.

## Step 3 Run the React App

Test the endpoint using the included React App.

From the 'app' directory in the terminal, run:

```sh
yarn start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in the web browser and see the text from the published content.

Type in the display name created earlier for the GET with params and POST request.

## How everything works

#### 2. Use the GraphQL schema for type generation without exposing the endpoint to the public

Running:

```sh
yarn codegen
```

The `codegen.yml` file will take the query included in `restification/app/queries/AllMembers.graphql` as well as the schema from `http://localhost/graphql/management/members` and creates a `generated.ts` file. This file contains types and hooks based on the query. The `codegen.yml` file also has access to the ID and Secret for authorization.

## Try it yourself

## Troubleshooting

If your REST endpoint is displaying 'INVALID CREDENTIALS'. Be sure that your REST Mapping's **Access** is changed to **Anyone** rather than **inherit**.
