## GraphQL RESTification

At times, consumers of Brightspot's API may not be inherently equipped to handle GraphQL and may instead prefer a RESTful API. Perhaps they have specific data requirements for the API, and as such, they want a custom API with specific keys and fields.

GraphQL RESTification involves converting a GraphQL API into a RESTful API by replacing a single GraphQL endpoint with multiple RESTful endpoints. RESTification grants the benefit of controlling the structure of the data, allowing the JSON response to be easily configured, and choosing what fields to return using GraphQL's native query fields.

This example demonstrates how to set up GraphQL queries into individual REST API endpoints in Brightspot.

## What you will learn

1. [Use Brightspot to create REST Mapping API endpoints](#1-create-rest-mapping-api-endpoints).

## Running the example application

> **_Note_** Just starting? Refer to the [README](/README.md) at the root of the `react-examples` repository for details on running example applications in depth.

### Install dependencies

Run the following command from the `restification/app` directory:

```sh
$ yarn

```

The front-end application will not function correctly until the steps are completed.

## Step 1: Create Content Member (REST) Content Type

In Brightspot from the navigation menu **&#x2630;**, under **Admin**, select **Content Types**.

Under the **New Content Type** form do the following:

1. In the **Name** field, enter **Member (REST)**.
2. Under **Items**, click &#10753; then select **Text Field**.
3. In the text field form, in the **Name** field, enter **Display Name**.
4. At the bottom of the form, toggle on **Search Filter?** and **Required**.

| Text Field: Display Name                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="Text Field: Display Name " src="documentation/images/text-field-display-name.png"> |

5. Repeat steps 2-3 to add three more text fields, named **First Name**, **Last Name** and **Email** repectively.
6. Repeat step 2 to add a **Number Field** with the name **Phone Number**.
7. Click **SAVE** at the bottom of the page.

| Member (REST) Content Type                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="Member (REST) Content Type" src="documentation/images/member-rest-content-type.png"> |

## Step 2: Create Content Management API (CMA) Endpoint

With the content type created, using the navigation menu **&#x2630;**, under **Admin**, select **APIs**.

1. In the left pane, from the **Create** list, select **GraphQL Content Management API**, then click **New** to be presented with the form to create the API.
2. In the **Name** field, enter **Members API**.
3. Under **Read Types** and **Read/Write Types** fields, using the drop down menu select **Member (REST)**.
4. Click Save.

| Members API (CMA) Endpoint                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="Members API (CMA) Endpoint " src="documentation/images/members-api-cma.png"> |

## Step 3: Building the Query and Create REST Mappings

From the navigation menu **&#x2630;**, under **Developer** &rarr; select **GraphQL Explorer**, then select **Members API** from the **Select GraphQL Endpoint** dropdown.

In this example, the query created retrieves all members, restricting the data returned to only the members' display name. One of the benefits using GraphQL to created the REST endpoings is the ability to use [GraphQL's Aliases](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases) to alter the shape of the data.

Copy and paste the followng query into the explorer:

```
query AllMembers {
  ListOfMembers: brightspot_generated_memberrest_MemberRestQuery {
    members: items {
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

`brightspot_generated_memberrest_MemberRestQuery` simply becomes `ListOfMembers`, `items` becomes `members` adding an extra layer of readability.

To test the query, click the play/execute button.

#### 1. Create REST mapping API endpoints

After testing the query, create the first REST Map by clicking the gear icon &#9881; in the GraphQL Explorer (located on the upper right-hand corner of the page) and selecting **Create REST Mapping**. The **New GraphQL REST Mapping** form opens:

| GraphQL Explorer with REST Mapping Endpoint Form                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img alt="REST Mapping Endpoint Form" src="documentation/images/all-members-rest-map.png"> |

The **REST Endpoint** is pre-selected with **Create New...** being the first REST Endpoint created.

1. Under **REST Mapping Name**, **AllMembers** will be pre-populated. This is based on the query name.
2. Under **REST Mapping Method(s)**, ensure that **GET** request is selected.
3. Under **REST Mapping Path**, the REST mapping path is automatically generated as **/all-members** from the query name.
4. Click **Create**.

As this is the first mapping, the a new form opens to create the REST API mapping, with the title **New REST GraphQL Mapping API**

| REST GraphQL Mapping API Form                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="REST GraphQL Mapping API Form" src="documentation/images/members-api-rest.png"> |

1. Under **Name**, enter 'Members API'.
2. Under Access, select **Anyone**. Access by default is set to inherit based on the endpoint used.
3. Click **Save**.

> - After entering the name, the **Path Prefix** section automatically generates **/members-api**
> - The **GraphQL Endpoint** section defaults to the API you are working on in the GraphQL Explorer
> - The **Paths** section at the bottom is automatically generated based on the **Path Prefix** and the **REST Mapping Name**

Repeat the process using the following query:

```
query Member($arguments: [String]) {
  Member: brightspot_generated_memberrest_MemberRestQuery(
    where: { predicate: "displayName = ?", arguments: $arguments }
  ) {
    members: items {
      displayName
      email
    }
  }
}
```

At the bottom of the explorer, open the 'QUERY VARIABLES' section and enter the variable to test. Your variable looks similar to the following:

```json
{
  "arguments": "<Member Display Name Here>"
}
```

Test the query to confirm the results are as expected.

Create the REST Mapping for the query:

| REST Mapping Endpoint Form: GET Member                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="REST Mapping Endpoint Form: GET Member" src="documentation/images/get-member.png"> |

The form will be automatically completed but under 'REST Mapping Method(s)'.

Repeat the process once more, this time copying and pasting the following mutation:

```
mutation CreateMember($displayName: String = "", $firstName: String = "", $lastName: String = "", $email: String = "", $phoneNumber: Float = 1.5) {
  brightspot_generated_memberrest_MemberRestSave(
    diffs: {brightspot_generated_memberrest_MemberRestDiff: {
      displayName: $displayName,
      firstName: $firstName,
      lastName: $lastName,
      email: $email,
      phoneNumber: $phoneNumber
    }
    }) {
    displayName
    firstName
    lastName
    email
    phoneNumber
  }
}
```

This mutation will become a POST request to create a new member. Because it is a mutation, the **REST Mapping Method** selects POST automatically:

| REST Mapping Endpoint Form: Create Member                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="REST Mapping Endpoint Form" src="documentation/images/create-member.png"> |

## Step 4: Testing the REST Endpoints

1. Test the GET endpoint by visiting [http://localhost/members-api/all-members](http://localhost/members-api/all-members).
2. Test the second REST mapping endpoint with a GET request made with the display name as the parameter by visiting 'http://localhost/members-api/member?arguments=Member_Display_Name_Here'.
3. Test the POST request from the command line using cURL, copy and paste the following:

   ```
   curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost/members-api/create-member' \
   --form 'displayName="TestUser"' \
   --form 'firstName="TestFirstName"' \
   --form 'lastName="TestSurname"' \
   --form 'email="test@test.com"' \
   --form 'phoneNumber="1112223333"'
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   {"data":{"brightspot_example_restification_MemberSave":{"displayName":"TestUser","firstName":"TestFirstName","lastName":"TestSurname","email":"test@test.com","phoneNumber":1.112223333E9}}}
   ```

You will now see that user is added in one of two ways:

1.  By navigating to Brightspot and verifying that **Member (REST)** content with the data just sent has been created.
2.  By navigating to [http://localhost/members-api/all-members](http://localhost/members-api/all-members) and verifying that the object: ` {"displayName":"TestUser"}` has been added to the array of members.

## Try it yourself

## Troubleshooting

If your REST endpoint is displaying 'INVALID CREDENTIALS', then ensure that your REST Mapping's **Access** is changed to **Anyone** rather than **inherit**.
