# Schema Versioning

GraphQL endpoints are versionless, following [best practices](https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/#versioning) schemas should evolve without breaking changes, but that does not mean breaking changes won't occur. As a schema evolves, it is best to have a process to detect any potential problems.

Brightspot stores a record whenever a schema changes and can be viewed in Brightspot. This example demonstrates how to track changes to schemas and compare schema versions programatically. The front-end application uses [GraphQL Inspector](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/inspector/docs/introduction) to view schema changes before updating any code (helping you catch any breaking changes), and also [Codegen](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started) to generate types based on the most up-to-date schema version.

## What you will learn

1. [Create an endpoint that exposes the schema version data](#1-creating-an-endpoint-that-returns-schema-versions).
2. [Compare schema versions programatically](#2-comparing-graphql-schema-versions-via-graphql-inspector).

## Running the example application

Compiled successfully!

You can now view graphql-schema-versioning in the browser.
```

## How everything works

In Brightspot, publish at least one **Movie** if you wish to see anything rendered on the front end.

Run the front-end application to confirm that the published **Movie** content renders (if it is already running, refresh the browser).

At this stage, there is one schema. GraphQL Inspector requires two schemas to run a comparison and to detect if there are any breaking changes. One of the schemas will be the latest schema that was available when the command `yarn codegen` was executed successfully.

The command also runs a script file [getTimeStamp.mjs](app/getTimeStamp.mjs). This script records the time it runs and writes the timestamp to the included [timeStamp](app/schemas/timeStamp.mjs) file.

Creating a second updated schema requires changes to the [Movie view model](brightspot/src/brightspot/example/graphql_schema_versioning/MovieViewModel.ts)

Make the following changes:

**_Edit:_** Change the method name `getDescription()` to `getPlot()`:

```js
  @JavaMethodParameters()
  @JavaMethodReturn(String)
  getPlot(): string {
    return this.model.description
  }
```

Uncomment the following methods:

```js
  @JavaMethodParameters()
  @JavaMethodReturn(Number)
  getReleaseYear(): number {
    return this.model.releaseYear
  }

  @JavaMethodParameters()
  @JavaMethodReturn(String)
  getDirector(): string {
    return this.model.director
  }
```

Upload your Brightspot types once again. This will create another schema and will be the most up-to-date version.

### 1: Creating an endpoint that returns schema versions

Brightspot stores the history of all schema changes, this example creates an endpoint that points to that data.

The [SchemaVersioningEndpoint](brightspot/src/brightspot/example/graphql_schema_versioning/SchemaVersioningEndpoint.ts) implements `ContentManagementApiEndpointV1`. The method `getEntryFields` is used to query GraphQL schema versions for all endpoints in this application:

```js
  [`getEntryFields()`](): List<ContentManagementEntryPointField> {
    let schemaClass = new ContentManagementEntryPointField(
      GraphQLSchemaVersion.class,
      true
    )
```

The [SchemaVersioningClient](brightspot/src/brightspot/example/graphql_schema_versioning/SchemaVersioningClient.ts) allows access the `Schema Versioning Endpoint`.

The command `yarn schemas` runs the script file [downloadSchemas.mjs](app/downloadSchemas.mjs).

What does the script do?

1. Calls the [schema versioning endpoint](brightspot/src/brightspot/example/graphql_schema_versioning/SchemaVersioningEndpoint.ts) with the query `graphqlSchemaQuery` and uses the credentials stored in the [env](app/.env) file. The query asks for the endpoint with the label **Schema Versioning Movie Endpoint** and sorts them by timestamp in a descending order:

```js
const graphqlSchemaQuery = `
    query Schemas {
      versions: com_psddev_graphql_GraphQLSchemaVersionQuery(
        where: { predicate: "endpoint/getLabel = ?", arguments: "Schema Versioning Movie Endpoint" }
        sorts: { order: descending, options: "timestamp" }
      ) {
```

2. Sends the schemas to the `parseSchemaURLS` function that uses the [timeStamp](app/schemas/timeStamp.mjs) file to get the latest schema available when the time stamp was created and the most recent schema available (they can be the same), stores them in their own object, and adds a name key and value.
3. Sends the two schema objects to `downloadSchemas`, which takes the URL in both schemas to open the URL and write files to the [schemas](app/schemas) directory, `codegenSchema.graphql` and `newSchema.graphql`.

Run the following from the [app](app) directory:

```sh
$ yarn schemas
```

```
‚ú®  Done in 0.24s.
```

The [schemas](app/schemas) directory now holds two GraphQL files, representing the schemas should you want to manually review the schemas.

With two schemas to compare, we can leverage GraphQL Inspector's [Schema Validation]('https://the-guild.dev/graphql/inspector/docs/essentials/diff') and compare the two schema versions.

### 2: Comparing GraphQL schema versions via GraphQL Inspector

Run the following from the [app](app) directory with `codegenSchema.graphql` as the old schema, and `newSchema.graphql` as the new schema:

```
npx graphql-inspector diff ./schemas/codegenSchema.graphql ./schemas/newSchema.graphql
```

The GraphQL Inspector runs and displays the number of changes. If there are no breaking changes, it returns a 'success' message. If there are breaking changes, it returns an ERROR message that serves as a warning that the front end needs to be updated to address these changes or the schema needs to be updated to restore and deprecate the field.

```sh
Detected the following changes (4) between schemas:

‚úñ  Field description was removed from object type Movie
‚úî  Field director was added to object type Movie
‚úî  Field plot was added to object type Movie
‚úî  Field releaseYear was added to object type Movie
error Detected 1 breaking change
```

As shown, before running the front-end application we know that in its current state, it will not run.

> **_Note_** the following is only necessary to run the front-end application with no issues based on the latest schema changes.

Based on the changes made, in order for Codegen to run, update the query in the front-end application to return the latest fields and types:

`graphql-schema-versioning/app/src/components/MoviesQuery.graphql`:

```
query Movies {
  AllMovies {
    movies {
      title
      plot
      releaseYear
      director
    }
  }
}
```

Update the `Movie.tsx` component to display the new fields and change 'description' to 'plot':

`graphql-schema-versioning/app/src/components/Movie.tsx`:

```ts
import { Movie } from '../generated'

interface MovieProp {
  movie: Movie | null
}

const MovieComponent = ({ movie }: MovieProp) => (
  <div className="movie-card">
    <h1>{movie?.title}</h1>
    <h2>{movie?.plot}</h2>
    <img
      className="movie-image"
      src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/movie-camera-vector-icon-isolated-object-white-background_661273-89.jpg"
      alt="movie"
    />
    <h3>{movie?.releaseYear}</h3>
    <h3>{movie?.director}</h3>
  </div>
)

export default MovieComponent
```

From the `graphql-schema-versioning/app` directory run:

```sh
$ yarn codegen
```

```
‚úî Parse Configuration
‚ùØ Generate outputs
‚úî Parse Configuration
‚úî Generate outputs
‚ú®  Done in 1.01s.
```

The `graphql-schema-versioning/app/src/generated.ts` file will now contain the new schema and field types. As a result, the front-end application runs with no errors.

Changing and uploading the view model as shown above will cause the schema to change, creating a new schema version.

## Try it yourself

Introduce new fields that do not break the front-end application:

1. Add new fields to `graphql-schema-versioning/brightspot/src/brightspot/example/graphql_schema_versioning/MovieViewModel.ts`.
2. From the `graphql-schema-versioning/brightspot`, upload the types.
3. Run or refresh the front-end application to load the schemas.
4. Download the schemas with the script shown earlier to compare.
5. Run Codegen after viewing the 'Success' message.
6. Run the front-end application to confirm there are no errors.
