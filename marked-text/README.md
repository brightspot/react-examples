# Marked Text

Brightspot's Rich Text Editor (RTE) field is stored in HTML format which is inherently nested. This can make it difficult for clients to parse and use the response data efficiently.

Marked Text is a JSON representation of a Brightspot RTE field. It contains all the metadata for rich-text objects and is structured to account for nested tags, represented cleanly without prior knowledge of the entire state. This makes it well-suited to the GraphQL ecosystem, and allows for maintaining the integrity of its type system.

While Marked Text's data structure is advantageous, it requires handling to render to any front-end and customize with great flexibility. Brightspot developed the Marked Text Library as a solution for handling and rendering Marked Text, along with the ability to customize its appearance and functionality.

## Using the example application

Publish an Article. Once published, the front end will render this article.

## How everything works

#### 1. Query for MarkedText:

[Article.tsx](app/src/components/Article.tsx). This file contains the front-end logic to focus on in this example.

- [ArticleMarkQuery](app/src/components/Article.tsx#L17) This variable holds the query made to return the article. The body contains the text and marks which forms the Marked Text object based on the view model:

```
const ArticleMarkQuery = `
  query ArticleMarkedTextQuery {
  Article {
    headline
    body {
      text
      marks {
        start
        end
        descendants
        data {
          ... on RteHtmlElement {
            __typename
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
`
```

#### 2. Render with Brightspot's Marked Text Library:

A look at the following rich text editor field:

| Rich Text Editor Field                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img alt="Rich Text Editor Field" src="images/rich-text-screenshot.png"> |

Produces the following Marked Text object from the body of the API response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Article": {
      "headline": "Marked Text: Intro",
      "body": {
        "text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
        "marks": [
          {
            "start": 0,
            "end": 19,
            "descendants": 3,
            "data": {

              "name": "p"
            }
          },
          {

              "__typename": "RteHtmlElement",
              "name": "i"
            }
          },
          {
            "start": 10,
            "end": 15,
            "descendants": 0,
            "data": {
              "__typename": "RteHtmlElement",
              "name": "u"
            }
          },
          {
            "start": 19,
            "end": 44,
            "descendants": 2,
            "data": {
              "__typename": "RteHtmlElement",
              "name": "p"
            }
          },
          {
            "start": 35,
            "end": 43,
            "descendants": 1,
            "data": {
              "__typename": "RteHtmlElement",
              "name": "b"
            }
          },
          {
            "start": 35,
            "end": 39,
            "descendants": 0,
            "data": {
              "__typename": "RteHtmlElement",
              "name": "i"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Brightspot provides a function that makes it easy to render the Marked Text data structure.

The library `@brightspot/marked-text` serves the function `markedTextTraversal`.

- `markedTextTraversal` takes two arguments:

  - MarkedText returned from the GraphQL API, this is the body of the Article in this example.
  - The Visitor object which contains two properties, `visitText` and `visitMark`, whose values are callback functions used to transform the MarkedText into the desired output.

  The `visitText` callback is triggered when reaching text, which is always a leaf node. It allows implementations to convert the text into an object of their choice and return it. If the text has a parent `Mark`, the transformed text will be included as an array item when visiting the parent mark. If null is returned, it will be excluded from the result.

  The `visitMark` callback is executed when a `Mark` is encountered during traversal. It follows a [post-order](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-postorder-traversal) traversal, the `children` array contains the `text` and `Mark` nodes that have been visited and transformed. Implementations have the flexibility to convert the `Mark` and its children into an object of their choosing and return it. If the current `Mark` has a parent `Mark`, the transformed `Mark` will be included as an item in the `children` array when visiting the parent `Mark`.

[Article Component](app/src/components/Article.tsx#L73)

- This component makes a call to the endpoint to return the published Article. The return is passing MarkedText (the Article body) as well as the Visitor object to the `markedTextTraversal` function import from the Brightspot Marked Text library.

  In this example, during the traversal, when reaching the visitText callback, the text is encapsulated within a [React `Fragment`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment). When arriving at `visitMark`, the call back function is taking the `data` property within `mark` and using type assertion to treat this property as a `RteHtmlElement`. It then uses React [`createElement`](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement) to return a React element using the `name` property for the element name, assigns a key and passes its `children`, an array of previously transformed`ReactNode`.

  ```js
  markedTextTraversal(article?.articleData?.body, {
    visitText: (text) => <Fragment key={key++}>{text}</Fragment>,
    visitMark: (mark, children: ReactNode[]) => {
      const element = mark.data as RteHtmlElement

      return React.createElement(
        element.name,
        { key: `k-${key++}` },
        children
      )
    },
  })
  ```

Output:

```
<p>The <b><i>quick</i> <u>brown</u> fox </b>jumps over the <b><i>lazy</i> dog</b>.</p>
```

Additionally, by providing a unified and customizable interface for traversing and transforming Marked Text, the `markedTextTraversal` function can simplify the integration of Marked Text with React or any other front-end library or framework.
