# Marked Text

Brightspot's Rich Text Editor (RTE) field is stored in HTML format which is inherently nested. This can make it difficult for clients to parse and use the response data efficiently.

Marked Text is a JSON representation of a Brightspot RTE field. It contains all the metadata for rich-text objects and is structured to account for nested tags, represented cleanly without prior knowledge of the entire state. This makes it well-suited to the GraphQL ecosystem, and allows for maintaining the integrity of its type system.

While Marked Text's data structure is advantageous, it requires handling to render to any front-end and customize with great flexibility. Brightspot developed the Marked Text Library as a solution for handling and rendering Marked Text, along with the ability to customize its appearance and functionality.

## Using the example application

Publish an Article. Once published, the front end will render this article.

## How everything works

#### 1. Query for MarkedText:

[Article.tsx](app/src/components/Article.tsx). This file contains the front-end logic to focus on in this example.

- [ArticleMarkQuery](app/src/components/Article.tsx#L17) This variable holds the query made to return the article. The body contains the text and marks which forms the Marked Text object based on the view model:

```
const ArticleMarkQuery = `
  query ArticleMarkedTextQuery {
  Article {
    headline
    body {
      text
      marks {
        start
        end
        descendants
        data {
          ... on RteHtmlElement {
            __typename
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
`
```

#### 2. Render with Brightspot's Marked Text Library:

A look at the following rich text editor field:

| Rich Text Editor Field                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img alt="Rich Text Editor Field" src="images/rich-text-screenshot.png"> |

Produces the following Marked Text object from the body of the API response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Article": {
      "headline": "Marked Text: Intro",
      "body": {
        "text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",

            }
          },
          {
            "start": 35,
            "end": 39,
            "descendants": 0,
            "data": {
              "__typename": "RteHtmlElement",
              "name": "i"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Brightspot provides a function to render the Marked Text data structure.

The library `@brightspot/marked-text` serves the function `markedTextTraversal`.

- `markedTextTraversal` takes two arguments:

  - MarkedText returned from the GraphQL API, this is the body of the Article in this example.
  - The Visitor object which contains two properties, `visitText` and `visitMark`, whose values are callback functions. These callback functions are used to transform the MarkedText into the implentors desired output.

  `markedTextTraversal` processes the MarkedText data structure. The first step in this process involves converting the original structure into a tree structure, similar to the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction). After this conversion, the function traverses this newly created tree using a [post-order traversal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-postorder-traversal). The function starts the transformation process from the most deeply nested node in the tree, moving upwards and outwards. This implies that the innermost elements are processed first, before the function deals with their parent nodes.

  The `visitText` function is called when the traversal reaches a block of text (which is always a leaf node in the tree structure). The text is passed as a string argument to the function allowing the implementor to optionally transform it and return a different value.

  The `visitMark` callback is triggered whenever the traversal process encounters a `Mark` within the tree structure. It has access to the current `Mark` and a `children` array. This array holds all the `text` and `Mark` nodes that have been visited and transformed by the traversal so far.

  > _**Note**_: The value returned from both `visitText` and `visitMark` will be an item in the `children` array of their respective parent node.

[Article Component](app/src/components/Article.tsx#L73)

- This component makes a call to the endpoint to return the published Article. The return is passing MarkedText (the Article body) as well as the Visitor object to the `markedTextTraversal` function import from the Brightspot Marked Text library.

  In this example, during the traversal, the visitText callback converts the string into a [React Fragment](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment) and returns it. This conversion makes it simple to then use the [React createElement](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement) API to pass this value as a child in the `children` array.

  When arriving at `visitMark`, the call back function is taking the `data` property within `mark` and using type assertion to treat this property as a `RteHtmlElement`.

  It then uses `React.createElement` to return a React element using the `name` property for the element name, assigns a key and passes its `children`, an array of previously transformed `ReactNode`.

  ```js
  markedTextTraversal(article?.articleData?.body, {
    visitText: (text) => <Fragment key={key++}>{text}</Fragment>,
    visitMark: (mark, children: ReactNode[]) => {
      const element = mark.data as RteHtmlElement

      return React.createElement(
        element.name,
        { key: `k-${key++}` },
        children
      )
    },
  })
  ```

Example Output:

```
<p>The <b><i>quick</i> <u>brown</u> fox </b>jumps over the <b><i>lazy</i> dog</b>.</p>
```

Additionally, by providing a unified and customizable interface for traversing and transforming Marked Text, the `markedTextTraversal` function can simplify the integration of Marked Text with React or any other front-end library or framework.
