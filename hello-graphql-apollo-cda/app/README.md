# Brightspot with React and GraphQL

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/brightspot/react-examples/tree/feature/cma-next) for running the Brightspot instance.

Once the development server is running, CD into `apollo-app/app` and run the following commands:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the result.

## Publish CMS Content

Publish a Hello World item in the CMS. Use the permalink created in the CMS to search for your Hello World in the frontend React app. This example show how simple it is to use Brightspot to power your application.
