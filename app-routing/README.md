# App Routing

This example highlights how simple it is to use JS Classes and the [Brightspot GraphQL API](https://www.brightspot.com/documentation/brightspot-cms-developer-guide/latest/graphql-api) ....

## Running the example application

Refer to the [README](/README.md) at the root of the `react-examples` repository for details on running example applications in depth. Make sure you have the Docker instance for the example applications running, then follow the quick-start steps starting in the `hello-world` directory:

To upload JS Classes in Brightspot (http://localhost/cms):

```
cd brightspot
yarn
npx brightspot types download
npx brightspot types upload src

```

To run the front-end:

```
cd app
yarn
yarn start
```

The front-end application will open automatically in the browser.
