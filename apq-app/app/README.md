# Automatic Persisted Queries with Brightspot, React, and Apollo Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For more information on automatic persisted queries, refer to the Apollo [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/persisted-queries/).

## Getting Started

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/brightspot/react-examples/tree/feature/cma-next) for running the Brightspot instance.

Run the development server. CD into `apq-app/app` and run the following commands:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the result.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Publish CMS Content

Publish a Hello World item in the CMS. For the title, use `Hello World` or change the path variable in `app/src/components/HelloWorldContainer.tsx` to the path you created (the permalink that is generated when you create a Hello World.)
