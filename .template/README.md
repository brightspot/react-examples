## Using JS Classes

JS Classes make it possible to create and modify Brightspot CMS content with JavaScript (TypeScript).

Run the following commands in the `brightspot` directory (if there is already a `brightspot.json` file you can skip the `npx brightspot config server http://localhost/cms` command):

```
yarn
npx brightspot config server http://localhost/cms
npx brightspot login
npx brightspot types download
npx brightspot types upload src
```

## Running the frontend application

In the `app` directory run the following command:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

The frontend application will open automatically in your browser.
