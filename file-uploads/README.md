# File Uploads
Since the official GraphQL specification does not manage file uploading, Brightspot's [Content Management API (CMA)](https://www.brightspot.com/documentation/brightspot-cms-developer-guide/hello-content-management-api) implements the [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec), a multipart form field structure for GraphQL requests used in various file upload client/server implementations.

This example demonstrates uploading files from a front-end application to Brightspot using a CMA endpoint, since uploading files is a GraphQL mutation (an update or deletion of data). This example uses the [apollo-upload-client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client) package.

## Running the example application

> **_Note_** Just starting? Refer to the [README](/README.md) at the root of the `react-examples` repository for details on running example applications in depth.

Run the following commands from the `brightspot-routing/app` directory:

### Install dependencies

```sh
$ yarn
```

```
[1/4] üîç Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó Linking dependencies...
[4/4] üî® Building fresh packages...
‚ú® Done in 6.03s.
```

### Start the React app

```sh
$ yarn start
```

```
Compiled successfully!
```

The React app opens automatically in the browser.

## Using the example application

1. <b>Create an API Client:</b>

    Navigate from **&#x2630;** to **Admin** &rarr; **APIs** &rarr; **Clients**, and select **New API Client**. Enter a name, and select **File Uploads Endpoint** for the endpoint. Copy the Client ID and add the ID to the `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID` field in the `file-uploads/app/.env` file. Click **Add API Key**, copy the key that is generated, and add to the `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` in the same `.env` file. Save the API Client.
<br>

2. <b>Upload images from front-end:</b>

   Either upload an image file or select the image URL option (this example currently only accepts image files, but can be configured to handle other file types). If you select file that is not an image, an error message appears on the page.

    Click the **X** on the top right of the image card to delete the uploaded image. Click on the information icon on the top left of the image card to view metadata for the image.

## How everything works

### 1. Upload files to Brightspot using GraphQL

To upload files to Brightspot, use the `StorageItem` field type for the respective `JavaField`: 

[Image.tsx](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/file_uploads/Image.ts)

```typescript
  @JavaField(StorageItem)
  file: StorageItem
```

Any field that is a `StorageItem` field type will have a `url` and `file` GraphQL input field available, making it possible to upload a file or files using the file URL or by uploading directly. 

In the front-end application, use the `createUploadLink` function provided from the apollo-upload-client package. This function creates a [terminating Apollo Link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/introduction/#the-terminating-link) for Apollo Client that fetches a GraphQL multipart request if the GraphQL variables contain files. 

[index.tsx](./app/src/index.tsx)

```typescript
const link = createUploadLink({
  uri: process.env.REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URL,
  headers: {
    'X-Client-ID': process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,  //  client id and secret are required for any CMA endpoint
    'X-Client-Secret': process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
}) 
```

Refer to the [Brightspot Documentation](https://www.brightspot.com/documentation/brightspot-cms-developer-guide/uploading-files-in-brightspot-content-management-api) for an example of uploading a file with a CMA endpoint without using Apollo Client.

> **_Note_** This is purely an example application. In your production environment, it is important to hide API Keys that are used for the CMA endpoint. Simply using environment variables does not hide keys, since they can be retrieved from the browser developer tools via the API fetch request.

### 2. Brightspot's Storage Item GraphQL fields

To view the available fields provided when using the `StorageItem` field type, use the GraphQL Explorer. Navigate from **&#x2630;** to **Developer** &rarr; **GraphQLExplorer** , then select the **File Uploads Endpoint** to query for Images. Make sure **Query** is selected on the bottom left pane (the default). Under `items`, select `file`. The following fields are available: 

| Storage Item GraphQL Fields                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img  height=600 alt="Storage Item GraphQL Fields" src="docs/images/storage-item-fields.png"> |



You can view `metadata` either by their `key` and `value` pairs, or in JSON format:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  brightspot_example_file_uploads_ImageQuery {
    items {
      file {
        metadata {
          entries {
            key
            value
          }
          json
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also choose to select specific metadata keys:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  brightspot_example_file_uploads_ImageQuery {
    items {
      file {
        metadata {
          entries(keys: "originalFilename") {
            value
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

You can also view metadata for an Image by selecting a published Image item from the dashboard, then clicking on the ellipsis icon (**‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢**) on the top right of the image, then selecting **Source Data**. 

> **_Note_** Metadata for an image is only provided when the image is uploaded using the `file` input field. 

### 3. Use MIME Type annotations for limiting file upload types

To specify the MIME Type for a file upload in Brightspot, use the `@MimeTypes` annotation:

[Image.tsx](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/file_uploads/Image.ts)

```typescript
  @JavaField(StorageItem)
  @MimeTypes({ value: '+image/' })
  file: StorageItem
```

This annotation specifies valid MIME types for the target StorageItem field using the [SparseSet](https://artifactory.psdops.com/psddev-releases/com/psddev/dari-util/3.3.607-xe0f27a/dari-util-3.3.607-xe0f27a-javadoc.jar!/com/psddev/dari/util/SparseSet.html) representation.


## Try it yourself
The following is a suggestion for learning more about file uploads with JS Classes and Brightspot:

- Try uploading a file that is not an image and observe the result. 
- Create a File class instead of a Image class, and limit the StorageItem to only accept certain file types. Refer to [Common MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) for possible MIME types to use (hint: your `@MimeTypes` annotation should look something like: `@MimeTypes({ value: '+application/pdf +application/txt' })`).

## Troubleshooting
Refer to the [Common Issues](/README.md) section in the respository README for assistance.
