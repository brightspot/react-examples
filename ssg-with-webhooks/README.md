# Static Site Generation with Webhooks

Static web pages are faster and lighter than dynamic sites, resulting in better performance and load times. They are typically used for content that rarely changes because updating static pages requires lengthy rebuilds of the entire site. However, newer front-end frameworks allow for on-demand updates to individual pages, providing fast and up-to-date pages without the limitation of frequent site rebuilds.

This example demonstrates how to leverage Brightspot's Webhooks feature to trigger web page regeneration when content is published or updated.

## Using the example application

The Next.js app is a simple blog site with content consisting of **Blog Posts**. They are set up to automatically generate permalinks as shown in the [Brightspot Routing](https://github.com/brightspot/react-examples/tree/main/brightspot-routing) example.

Publish one or more **Blog Posts**. After a few seconds, refresh the Next.js web page and navigate through the app to find the published content. Note that the content appears on the app without needing to rebuild.

### 1. Create a payload and topic

In this context, a payload is the data structure that is sent from Brightspot to the front-end app. The app needs to know which pages to regenerate, so the payload should include a list of unique identifiers for those pages.

A payload is created by extending the `JavaRecord` class and adding fields that represent the desired data structure.

This example uses a data structure that mirrors the [Brightspot Routing](https://github.com/brightspot/react-examples/tree/main/brightspot-routing) example. The payload includes a `paths` field to store a list of URL paths (and associated metadata) of new or updated content.

[BlogPostPayload.ts](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/ssg_with_webhooks/notification/BlogPostPayload.ts)

```ts
export default class BlogPostPayload extends JavaClass(
  'brightspot.example.ssg_with_webhooks.notification.BlogPostPayload',
  JavaRecord
) {
  @JavaField(List.Of(BlogPostPayloadPath))
  paths?: List<BlogPostPayloadPath>
}
```

The `paths` field is defined as a list of objects so that the URL path metadata is packaged together with the path itself. Since this type is an object, it is defined as a separate class extending `JavaRecord`. The `@Embedded` annotation is added so that the values of the subfields are added to the payload.

[BlogPostPayloadPath.ts](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/ssg_with_webhooks/notification/BlogPostPayloadPath.ts)

```ts
@Embedded
export default class BlogPostPayloadPath extends JavaClass(
  'brightspot.example.ssg_with_webhooks.notification.BlogPostPayloadPath',
  JavaRecord
) {
  @JavaField(String)
  path?: string

  @JavaField(List.Of(String))
  siteUrls?: List<string>

  @JavaField(String)
  type?: string
}
```

A topic bundles the payload together and allows for its delivery. It is created with a class that extends the `AbstractTopic<P>` abstract class where `P` is the payload class. Topics can optionally store additional configuration fields.

The topic in this example does not use any configuration fields and only overrides the `toStringFormat()` class method for debugging purposes.

[BlogPostTopic.ts](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/ssg_with_webhooks/notification/BlogPostTopic.ts)

```ts
export default class BlogPostTopic extends JavaClass(
  'brightspot.example.ssg_with_webhooks.notification.BlogPostTopic',
  AbstractTopic.Of(BlogPostPayload)
) {
  toStringFormat(subscriber: Subscriber, payload: BlogPostPayload): string {
    return payload.getLabel()
  }
}
```

### 2. Create a notification trigger

To keep the front-end app up-to-date at all times, it should receive a notification every time content is created or updated. One way to capture these moments is by overriding the `afterSave()` method. Doing so will serve as the trigger to send the notification.

This example separates the notification trigger from the data model by using a [Modification](https://www.brightspot.com/documentation/brightspot-cms-developer-guide/latest/modifications) of the `BlogPost` model.

Within the overriden `afterSave()` method, the payload can be created, filled with the relevant URL path data, and sent as a notification.

Within the `afterSave()` method, a payload is created and its `paths` field is populated with the URL path data from the published content. Then a notification is published using the matching topic and the newly instantiated payload.

[BlogPostTrigger.ts](./brightspot/src/brightspot/example/ssg_with_webhooks/notification/BlogPostTrigger.ts)

```ts
export default class BlogPostTrigger extends JavaClass(
  'brightspot.example.ssg_with_webhooks.notification.BlogPostTrigger',
  Modification.Of(BlogPost)
) {
  afterSave(): void {
    super.afterSave()

    let BlogPostPayload = ClassFinder.getClass(
      'brightspot.example.ssg_with_webhooks.notification.BlogPostPayload'
    )

    // Creates a new payload
    let payload = new BlogPostPayload() as BlogPostPayload

    // Gets the raw URL path data for this published content
    let paths = this.getAllPaths()

    // Converts the raw URL path objects into strings and stores them on the payload's path field
    payload.paths = this.convertPathsToPayloadPaths(paths)

    // Publishes a notification with the blog post topic and payload attached
    Notification.publish(BlogPostTopic.getClass() as Class<Topic<any>>, payload)
  }

  /***
   * Helper method that returns the URL path data for this published content
   ***/
  getAllPaths(): JavaSet<Path> {
    let paths = this.as(DirectoryData.class).getPaths()

    return paths
  }

  /***
   * Helper method that takes raw URL path data and converts it into strings to
   * match the BlogPostPayloadPath fields.
   ***/
  convertPathsToPayloadPaths(paths: JavaSet<Path>): List<BlogPostPayloadPath> {
    // ... implementation
  }
}
```

### 3. Create an endpoint to manage webhooks

The previous step determines when notifications are sent, but not their delivery method. This step creates a REST Management API endpoint that allows developers to create webhooks that point to their front-end app.

To create a REST Management API endpoint in Brightspot, navigate to **‚ò∞** &rarr; **Admin** &rarr; **APIs** &rarr; **Create** &rarr; **REST Management API** &rarr; **New**, enter a name, specify a path (or use the default), and click **Save**.

<details>
<summary>
<span>
<b>Create REST Management API</b>
</span>
</summary>
TODO:
<img  height="400px" src="/ssg-with-webhooks/brightspot/documentation/images/themeContentStyles.png" alt="Create REST Management API in Brightspot">
</details>

> **_Note_** REST Management API endpoints require client credentials to be accessed outside of the Brightspot UI. See {TODO: add link here} for detailed instructions on creating an API Client and API Keys.

### 4. Add a webhook to the endpoint

A webhook and its destination URL can be created through the Brightspot UI or through an external HTTP request.

This example uses a Node.js script to POST a webhook to the REST Management API endpoint created in the previous step. It uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to send a request to the `/webhooks` route of the endpoint with a body containing the desired webhook topic (defined in step 1) and a destination URL.

[createWebhook.mjs](./app/createWebhook.mjs)

```js
const postWebhook = async () => {
  fetch(`${process.env.REST_MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINT}/webhooks`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'X-Client-Id': process.env.CLIENT_ID,
      'X-Client-Secret': process.env.CLIENT_API_KEY,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((res) => console.log(res))
}

postWebhook()
```

The body of the request must be structured like the code snippet below. The `url` is the full destination URL for the webhook and the `topic._type` is the full class name of the webhook topic defined in step 1.

```js
const body = {
  url: process.env.NEXTJS_WEBHOOK_ROUTE,
  topic: {
    _type: 'brightspot.example.ssg_with_webhooks.notification.BlogPostTopic',
  },
}
```

> **_Note_** The script is mapped to the `yarn webhook` command defined in the `package.json` file.

### 5. Create a Next.js webhook handler

This example uses Next.js [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) and [On-Demand Revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation) to handle the webhooks coming from Brightspot.

The Next.js webhook handler API route must match the URL destination defined in step 4. This example uses `pages/api/revalidate.ts`.

The body of the incoming webhook will be structured like the webhook payload defined in step 1. The list of URL path data is extracted from the request and a corresponding Next.js app pages are revalidated.

[revalidate.ts](./app/pages/api/revalidate.ts)

```ts
// data structure matches the payload defined in step 1
type Path = {
  path: string
  siteUrls?: string[]
  type: string
  _id: string
  _type: string
}

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  // extract URL path data from incoming webhook
  let paths: Path[] = req.body.data.paths || []

  // filter out paths that belong to other Sites
  paths = paths.filter((path) =>
    path.siteUrls?.some(
      (siteUrl) => siteUrl === process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BSP_SITE_URL
    )
  )

  // revalidate each individual path
  for (const directoryPath of paths) {
    try {
      await res.revalidate(directoryPath.path)
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err)
    }
  }

  // additionally, revalidate the 'Home' page
  if (paths.length > 0) {
    try {
      await res.revalidate('/')
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err)
    }
  }

  return res.json({ revalidated: true })
}
```
