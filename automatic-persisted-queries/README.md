# Automatic Persisted Queries

With GraphQL, clients send queries to the server as HTTP requests that include the query string to execute. Unfortunately, the size of a query string can become quite large, which can negatively impact network performance.

To resolve this issue, Brightspot supports two types of [persisted](https://www.brightspot.com/documentation/brightspot-cms-developer-guide/graphql-understanding-persisted-queries) queries: [automatic](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/) (APQ) and [static](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-client/persisted-graphql-queries/) (SPQ).

Persisted queries positively impact network performance in two ways:

1. By sending a smaller query string in the network request.
2. By enabling the use of the HTTP `GET` method for query network requests (since the query size is small enough to use `GET`), thus making it possible to take advantage of the browser cache and [integrate with a CDN](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/#using-get-requests-with-apq-on-a-cdn).

This example demonstrates how to use APQs with Brightspot and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), using [best practices](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/operation-best-practices/) for GraphQL queries. The example configuration provides a mock CDN to demonstrate the performance benefits possible with APQs and CDNs.

## Using the example application

#### Front end:

The front end is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application.

The UI displays an Aviation Alphabet Converter page (option to use either an input field or checkboxes to convert letters). Both the text input and checkboxes run a GraphQL query to fetch data.

Key points to observe in the UI:

1.  **Cache control** : Value displays if a cache-control response header is set in Brightspot.
2.  **Select query type** : "Good" query types implement best practices for queries and "Bad" query types implement practices to avoid. For details on implementation refer to the comments found in the query files in `app/queries`.
3.  Query execution details: `GET` or `POST` for HTTP method used, `MISS` or `HIT` for CDN caching, and query execution time in milliseconds.

#### Brightspot:

1. If you want to add a cache-control header to query responses, navigate to: **&#x2630;** &rarr; **Admin** &rarr; **APIs** &rarr; **Endpoints** &rarr; **Aviation Alphabet Endpoint**. In the **Cache Control** field, enter `max-age=80000`. In the browser, trigger a network request to see the cache-control value display in the UI. You will also notice that `HIT` will appear for responses that are [cached](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-caching/) by the CDN. Execution time will vary based on `HIT` or `MISS`.
   Refer to MDN's [cache control documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) for more information on configuring cache control.

2. To view what request data sent to the endpoint looks like, navigate to **&#x2630;** &rarr; **Developer** &rarr; **GraphQL Explorer** &rarr; , then select **Aviation Alphabet Endpoint** from the dropdown list. Select any fields you like in the left pane so that a query populates in the middle pane. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner, then select **Persisted Query Extension**. A popup appears with the POST Body and GET URL Path.

POST Body:

```json
{
  "query": "query MyQuery {\n  AviationAlphabetEndpoint {\n    codes {\n      a\n    }\n  }\n}",
  "extensions": {
    "persistedQuery": {
      "sha256Hash": "6e4a307f9abd3fcc0b84613c2b4a5387424d2390147ec1734ece6b6acb4cdd7d"
    }
  }
}
```

GET URL Path:

```sh
/graphql/delivery/apq?extensions=%7B%22persistedQuery%22%3A%7B%22sha256Hash%22%3A%226e4a307f9abd3fcc0b84613c2b4a5387424d2390147ec1734ece6b6acb4cdd7d%22%7D%7D
```

The client sends a hash of the query to execute, along with variables, as a `GET` request. If Brightspot recognizes the hash (since the request has been made before), it will execute the associated query and return the results. If it doesn't recognize the hash, Brightpost returns the following error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "PersistedQueryNotFound"
    }
  ]
}
```

The client will then send a HTTP `POST` request with the same hashed value along with the respective query (the `POST` Body shown above). Brightspot validates the hash, and then stores the query, processes the request, and returns the result.

Ideally, you want to avoid `POST` requests when possible, since a `POST` request using APQ actually decreases network performance (since two queries are sent instead of one).

## How everything works

#### 1. Enable APQs in Brightspot

1. [Create a persisted query protocol instance](<(brightspot/src/brightspot/example/automatic_persisted_queries/CustomAPQProtocol.ts)>): A persisted query protocol implements `AutomaticPersistedQueryProtocol`, which enables generating a persisted query extension (the hashed value of a query), and getting queries by hash. The protocol must provide the following methods:

- `getSharedSecret`: This method sets a secret (or [salt](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)#:~:text=In%20cryptography%2C%20a%20salt%20is,to%20safeguard%20passwords%20in%20storage>)) to increase security - only clients that hash queries along with the respective salt are valid. Return an empty string if a salt isn't desired.

  ```typescript
  [`getSharedSecret()`](): string {
    return 'secret'
  }
  ```

- `getHashAlgorithm`: Brightspot provides a `Sha256PersistedQueryHashAlgorithm` class for generating query hashes. You can also add a custom hash algorithm.

  ```typescript
  [`getHashAlgorithm()`](): AutomaticPersistedQueryHashAlgorithm {
      return new Sha256PersistedQueryHashAlgorithm()
  }
  ```

2. Define your persisted query protocol in the [endpoint](brightspot/src/brightspot/example/automatic_persisted_queries/AviationAlphabetEndpoint.ts):

   ```typescript
   [`getPersistedQueryProtocol()`](): PersistedQueryProtocol {
       let CustomAPQProtocol = ClassFinder.getClass(
         'brightspot.example.automatic_persisted_queries.CustomAPQProtocol'
       )
     return new CustomAPQProtocol()
     }
   ```

> **_Note_** Adding cache-control response headers is optional but recommended if using a CDN.

3. Add cache control headers to the [endpoint](brightspot/src/brightspot/example/automatic_persisted_queries/AviationAlphabetEndpoint.ts):

```typescript
  onCreate(response: ViewResponse) {
    super.onCreate(response)
    if (this.model.cacheControl) {
      response.addHeader('Cache-Control', this.model.cacheControl) // The `cache-control` value comes from the `cacheControl` field set on the endpoint.
    }
  }
```

#### 2. Configure a front-end application to use APQs with Brightspot

1. Create an [Apollo Client instance](app/lib//client.ts): This example adds a salt, so customization is needed. Follow the instruction for [Apollo Client setup](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/#apollo-client-setup) if no customization is needed.

```typescript
const persistedQueriesLink = createPersistedQueryLink({
  generateHash: async (schema: DocumentNode) => {
    const secret = process.env.SECRET_KEY! // Must be the same salt defined in the persisted query protocol in Brightspot
    const message = secret.concat(print(schema))
    const result = await sha256(message) //The hashing algorithm used must be the same as that defined in `the Brightspot persisted query protocol
    return result
  },
  useGETForHashedQueries: true,
})
```

- [Configure environment variables if needed](app/.env):
  - `SECRET_KEY`: Salt set in the Brightspot persisted query protocol.
  - `GRAPHQL_URL`: URL for the Brightspot GraphQL API endpoint.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST`: URL for the front-end application. This is used to make fetch requests using Next.js [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
